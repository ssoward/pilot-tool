This means that for those with a mature family tree, there is a great probability that the names OR will provide are related to them.\n\nHowever, because most of the time patrons have not done the actual work of preparing most of the names that OR presents to them, many times they do not feel a particular connection with them. Although patrons using OR cannot select the names they receive and take to the temple, they can learn more about them and in that way develop a connection with them.\n\nThe proposal is to help increase the connection between OR users and the names they receive and take to the temple by providing them with helpful information that helps create relatedness and connection with their ancestors.

The scripts/languages we do not currently support include Hebrew, Amharic, a number of Indian scripts, Georgian, Armenian, Serbian and Ukrainian, among others.\n2. We would retire all transliterators written in procedural code, reducing the complexity of the transliteration service and reducing its maintenance costs.\n3. lama-ut would provide phonetic transliteration, resulting in a Romanization that would be phonically far more similar to the original than our current transliterators, which simply performs character replacement.",
